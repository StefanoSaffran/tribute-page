                <h3>Important events in Hawking's life</h3>
                <li><strong>1942</strong> - Hawking was born on 8 January 1942. He had two younger sisters, Philippa and
                    Mary, and an adopted brother, Edward Frank David (1955–2003).</li>
                <li><strong>1950</strong> - Hawking's father became head of the division of parasitology at the National
                    Institute for Medical Research, the family moved to St Albans, Hertfordshire.</li>
                <li><strong>1959</strong> - Hawking began his university education at University College, Oxford, at the
                    age of 17.</li>

                        However difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. It matters
                        that
                        you don't just give up.

                <li><strong>1962</strong> - After receiving a first-class BA degree in physics and completing a trip to
                    Iran with a friend, he began his graduate work at Trinity Hall, Cambridge</li>
                <li><strong>1966</strong> - In his work, and in collaboration with Penrose, Hawking extended the
                    singularity theorem concepts first explored in his doctoral thesis.</li>
                <li><strong>1970</strong> - In 1970, Hawking postulated what became known as the second law of black
                    hole dynamics, that the event horizon of a black hole can never get smaller.</li>
                <li><strong>1974</strong> - His results, which Hawking presented from 1974, showed that black holes emit
                    radiation, known today as Hawking radiation. A few weeks later Hawking was elected a Fellow of the
                    Royal Society (FRS). At the time, he was one of the youngest scientists to become a Fellow.</li>
                <li><strong>1975</strong> - In 1975, he was awarded both the Eddington Medal and the Pius XI Gold Medal
                </li>
                <li><strong>1976</strong> - In 1976 the Dannie Heineman Prize, the Maxwell Prize and the Hughes Medal.
                </li>
                <li><strong>1978</strong> - In 1978 he received the Albert Einstein Medal and an honorary doctorate from
                    the University of Oxford.</li>
                <li><strong>1983</strong> - Hawking subsequently developed the research in collaboration with Jim
                    Hartle, and in 1983 they published a model, known as the Hartle–Hawking state.</li>
                <li><strong>1988</strong> - His book <em>A Brief History of Time</em> was published in April 1988 in the
                    US and in June in the UK, and it proved to be an extraordinary success, rising quickly to the top of
                    best-seller lists in both countries and remaining there for months.</li>

                <li><strong>1989</strong> - In the 1989 Birthday Honours, he was appointed a Companion of Honour (CH).
                </li>
                <li><strong>1994</strong> - In 1994, at Cambridge's Newton Institute, Hawking and Penrose delivered a
                    series
                    of six lectures that were published in 1996 as "The Nature of Space and Time".</li>
                <li><strong>2001</strong> - Hawking continued his writings for a popular audience, publishing The
                    Universe in a Nutshell in 2001,[180] and A Briefer History of Time, which he wrote in 2005 with
                    Leonard Mlodinow to update his earlier works with the aim of making them accessible to a wider
                    audience, and God Created the Integers, which appeared in 2006.</li>
                <li><strong>2006</strong> - Along with Thomas Hertog at CERN and Jim Hartle, from 2006 on Hawking
                    developed a theory of "top-down cosmology", which says that the universe had not one unique initial
                    state but manydifferent ones, and therefore that it is inappropriate to formulate a theory that
                    predicts the universe's currentconfiguration from one particular initial state.</li>
                <li><strong>2007</strong> - In 2007, Hawking and his daughter Lucy published George's Secret Key to the
                    Universe, a children's book designed to explain theoretical physics in an accessible fashion and
                    featuring characters similar to those in the Hawking family.</li>
                <li><strong>2009</strong> - Hawking retired as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics.
                </li>
                <li><strong>2015</strong> - On 20 July 2015, Hawking helped launch Breakthrough Initiatives, an effort
                    to search for extraterrestrial life. Hawking created Stephen Hawking: Expedition New Earth, a
                    documentary on space colonisation, as a 2017 episode of Tomorrow's World.
                </li>
                <li><strong>2017</strong> - In July 2017, Hawking was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from Imperial
                    College London.</li>
                <li><strong>2018</strong> - Hawking's final paper – A smooth exit from eternal inflation? – was
                    published in the Journal of High Energy Physics on 27 April 2018.</li>
